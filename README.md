# PgHstore

This is just a gem alias for https://github.com/seamusabshere/pg-hstore

It has a gem dependency `pg-hstore`, but does not contain any files or add any paths to `$LOAD_PATH`.

## Rationale

The gem `pg-hstore` should be named `pg_hstore`, but it's not, yet.

## TODO

Rename `pg-hstore` to `pg_hstore` and notify maintainers of gem dependencies (like [`activerecord-postgres-hstore`](https://github.com/engageis/activerecord-postgres-hstore)).
